This is a run down of our reddit data story.

Indeed our goals are to find patterns in the language usage. But for real, why are we assuming that a higher language quality equals 
a better cognitive process or even a better congitive output? It seems to me that it's quite a bourgeois/higher class way of thinking,
"quality" of language does not correlate with cognitive output? Or does it? We will see I guess.

### More testing

I kinda just want to see what this does tbh
